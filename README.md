# Board-Note-Grabber

## Motivation
My professor posted all of his class notes in an online directory.
It was a list of around 120 links to different image files, and I did not want to click on all of the links.
So, I wrote a program to download all of the files.
I thought it would be helpful if the images were stored in one file, so now the program can compile images into pdfs.

I realized that all my classmates would have the same problem, so I sent the pdf to my classmates and my professor.
I saved around 35 people 10 minutes of clicking, so I would say it was a success.
